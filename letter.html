          <p>
            It's going to be three years since you entered my life. That's three
            years of unforgettable memories, and many more to come.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each and every moment with you is a treasure, fuel to my hope. Once
            my dad said a very wise line —
            <em
              >“What's all the wealth for? If you don't have a woman in your
              life?”</em
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            I felt it deep in my heart, and the only thought in my mind at that
            moment was you.
          </p>

          <p>
            We don't know what we have written in life, but let's re-write it
            together. With all our hopes and love.
          </p>

          <p class="love-line">
            I love you with all my heart.
          </p>

          <p class="signature">
            Yours lovingly, <br />Chaitu<br />
